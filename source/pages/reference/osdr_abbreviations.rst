   RR-4_ShF#-W
      Mouse number # from payload RR-4 which underwent spaceflight (F) and a sham (Sh) surgical procedure where bone defects were filled by the bioabsorbable scaffold imbued with saline as a control. The whole body (W) was frozen and preserved on ISS.

   RR-4_ShG#-L
      Mouse number # from payload RR-4 from the ground control (G) group which underwent a sham (Sh) surgical procedure where bone defects were filled by the bioabsorbable scaffold imbued with saline as a control. The leg (L) was dissected from the carcass on ISS before the rest of the carcass was frozen.

   RR-4_ShV#-W
      Mouse number # from payload RR-4 from Vivarium Control (V) group which underwent a sham (Sh) surgical procedure where bone defects were filled by the bioabsorbable scaffold imbued with saline as a control. The whole body (W) was frozen and preserved on ISS.

   RR-4_NSB#-L
      Mouse number # from payload RR-4 from the baseline control (B) group which underwent no surgical (NS) as a control group. The leg (L) was dissected from the carcass on ISS before the rest of the carcass was frozen.

   RR-4_BMP_F#
      Mouse number # from payload RR-4 which underwent spaceflight (F) and a surgical procedure where bone defects were filled by similar bioabsorbable scaffold imbued with bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2).

   RR-4_TPO_G#
      Mouse number # from payload RR-4 from the ground control (G) group which underwent a surgical procedure where bone defects are filled with a novel bioabsorbable scaffold imbued with thrombopoietin (TPO).
